# Workflow::Join

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/am-kantox/workflow-join.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/am-kantox/workflow-join)


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'workflow-join'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install workflow-join

## Usage

```ruby
class Master
  include Workflow

  attr_accessor :slave

  def initialize(*)
    @slave = Slave.new
  end

  workflow do
    state :meeting do
      event :go, transitions_to: :after_meeting
    end
    state :after_meeting

    # before entering :after_meeting state, wait for @slave to enter :resolved state
    guard :@slave, inner: :after_meeting, outer: :resolved
    # OR:   guard :slave, inner: :after_meeting, outer: :resolved
    # OR:   guard inner: :after_meeting, outer: :resolved, &:slave
  end
end

class Slave
  include Workflow

  workflow do
    state :unresolved do
      event :resolve, transitions_to: :resolved
    end
    state :resolved
  end
end
```

### `ActiveRecord` support

Introduce two new fields in each model, that uses workflow joins:

* `workflow_pending_transitions`,
* `workflow_pending_callbacks`

and enjoy:

```ruby
  class Master < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_one :slave

    include Workflow

    workflow do
      state :meeting do
        event :go, transitions_to: :after_meeting
      end
      state :after_meeting

      # before entering :after_meeting state, wait for @slave to enter :resolved state
      guard :slave, inner: :after_meeting, outer: :resolved
      # OR: guard inner: :after_meeting, outer: :resolved, &:slave
    end
  end

  class Slave < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :master

    include Workflow

    workflow do
      state :unresolved do
        event :resolve, transitions_to: :resolved
      end
      state :resolved
    end
  end
```

As a matter of fact, this gem tries to create the fields above on first usage,
but since it happens in the middle of class loading process, the whole
application start crashes. That is an intended behavior! The columns will be
created and simple application restart will enable the feature.

This part is hardly tested, though, thatâ€™s why the preferred way would be to
create columns manually.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
